This directory includes some encoded examples for modelling traits. The systematic way of encoding has been described in the appendix of the paper. To run the examples:

1. Install `f2j` according to the instruction in README of the base repository [link](https://github.com/hkuplg/fcore)

2. Assuming in a OS X / Unix-like shell, `cd` into this directory and type `f2j -r <filename>`, where `<filename>` is the name of the file. For example, execute `f2j -r point.sf` and you should be able to expect to see something like this:

```bash
$ f2j point.sf -r
7, 11
```

where `7, 11` is the output of the program.
